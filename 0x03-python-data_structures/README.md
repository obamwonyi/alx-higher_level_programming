## 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project help solidify my understanding of basic python data structures like List and Tuples.

### Each task handled :

* 0. Print a list of integers : Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

* 1. Secure access to an element in a list : Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C 

* 2. Replace element : Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).

* 3. Print a list of integers... in reverse! : Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

* 4. Replace in a copy : Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).

* 5. Can you C me now? : Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string. 

* 6. Lists of lists = Matrix : Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.

* 7. Tuples addition : Write a function that adds 2 tuples.

* 8. More returns! : Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

* 9. Find the max : Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.

* 10. Only by 2 : Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

* 11. Delete at : Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

* 12. Switch : Complete the source ( https://github.com/alx-tools/0x03.py/blob/master/12-switch_py ) code in order to switch value of a and b

* 13. Linked list palindrome : 

Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

Prototype: int is_palindrome(listint_t **head);
Return: 0 if it is not a palindrome, 1 if it is a palindrome
An empty list is considered a palindrome
