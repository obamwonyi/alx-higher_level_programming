## 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project help solidify my understanding of basic python data structures like List and Tuples.

### Each task handled :

* 0. Print a list of integers : Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

* 1. Secure access to an element in a list : Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C 

* 2. Replace element : Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).

* 3. Print a list of integers... in reverse! : Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

* 4. Replace in a copy : Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).

* 5. Can you C me now? : Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string. 

* 6. Lists of lists = Matrix : Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.

* 7. Tuples addition : Write a function that adds 2 tuples.
