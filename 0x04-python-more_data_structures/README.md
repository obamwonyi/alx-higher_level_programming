## 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

In this project I will be implementing python Datastructures like **SET** and **DICTIONARY** for other more
complex solutions

The various task I will be handling are :

* 0. Squared simple:<br>
    Conditions:<br>
        * Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix. 
        * Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
        * matrix is a 2 dimensional array 
        * Returns a new matrix:<br>
          * same size as matrix 
          * Each value should be the square of the value of the input 
        * Initial matrix should not be modified 
        * You are not allowed to import any module 
        * You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.
